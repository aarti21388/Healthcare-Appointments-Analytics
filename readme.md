## Project Description

The "Healthcare Appointments Analytics" project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative that delves into the intricacies of medical appointments and explores factors influencing patient attendance and no-show rates. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, the project aims to uncover valuable insights that can positively impact patient engagement and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

This project involves analyzing real-world medical appointment data through Time Series Analysis. Tasks include in this project are dataset cleaning, comprehensive analysis, and extracting insights using Python and MySQL.

Dataset: Hospital_patients_datasets.csv include below fields.

    'PatientId'
    'AppointmentID'
    'Gender'
    'ScheduledDay'
    'AppointmentDay'
    'Age'
    'Neighbourhood'
    'Scholarship'
    'Hipertension'
    'Diabetes'
    'patientid'
    'Alcoholism'
    'Handcap'
    'SMS_received'
    'No-show'

# module 1 : Dataset cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
```python
  
  Task 1:
  
  -- Load the dataset
  
  Read the patients data using 'Hospital_patients_datasets.csv' through pandas library and return the dataset for the further analysis.

  Task 2:
  -- Check for duplicate values
  
  Task 3:
  -- Find Null values

  Task 4:
  -- Convert Data Type

  Task 5:
  -- Renaming Columns
```

# module 2 : Comprehensive analysis,
```python
  
  Task 1:
  
  -- Drop Unwanted columns like: 
  'PatientId', 'AppointmentID', and 'Neighbourhood' from the DataFrame

  Task 2:
  -- Create new column

    Generates age group labels and categorizes the 'Age' values into bins with 20-year intervals. It creates a new column 'Age_group' containing the corresponding age group label for each individual and returns the modified DataFrame ds with this additional column for further analysis.

  
  Task 3:
  -- Drop unwanted Column 'Age'

  Task 4:
  -- streamlines the process of converting the 'NoShow' column into a binary   format, representing appointment attendance, and returns the DataFrame.

  Task 5:
  -- Exporting the Cleaned dataset

 ```
# module 3: extracting insights using SQL queries
